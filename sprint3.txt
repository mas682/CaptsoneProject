In the previous sprint we did our preliminary survey and added the ability to add projects for project providers.  We are still working on 
having the ability to edit projects once listed but this is almost done.  We also added the ability to add tags to the projects and assoicated 
them with the projects.  In the next phase, we will add the ability to have applicants have tags associated with their accounts so that we 
can suggest projects for them.  We will also add the ability to let the applicants search throught available projects.  While doing this, we 
also plan on working on a more focused survey to get better results that Mosse is going to send around for us.  
The user stories that we plan on addressing are:
As an applicant, I want to be able to search for a project to work on that meets certain interests of mine so that I can narrow down what projects are available for me to participate in.
As a project provider, I want to be able to edit and/or delete the project description that I list as I may make a mistake in it or have some additional information to add to it.
