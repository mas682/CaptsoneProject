For the previous sprint, we were able to make it so that a user could associate tags with themselves and suggest tags for them. 
We were also able to make it so that users could search tags via stemming, meaning that they could search for micro and all tags that 
begin with that will be returned.  We also added the ability to manage your account.  For the next sprint, we are going to try to add 
the ability for users to rank tags based on their importance.  We may not be able to add the functionality for actually using this to 
suggest projects though.  We are also going to add the ability to search through project descriptions for specific key words. And we will 
also clean up some of the user interface to make it more functional.
