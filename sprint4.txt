In the previous sprint, we were able to accomplish being able to fully edit a listed project and make changes to it.  We also added the 
ability to search through the projects based off of several tags and list all the projects that are available.  For the next sprint, we are 
going to add the ability for users to associate tags with themselves and recommend projects for them.  We are also going to work on the NLP 
stuff where if users do not use a tag that is commonly suggested, it will no longer be suggested.  We are also going to try to implement a 
grading system for tags so that users can rank some tags they associate with themselves higher than others.
The user stories we will address this week are:
As an applicant, I want to be able to sort the projects that are relevant to me by the best match so that I can get as close to a match for a project that I am looking for as possible.
As an applicant, I want to be able to skip the interest survey when I access the website as I want to just look at all the projects, and not only ones that are suggested based off of the questions I answer.
