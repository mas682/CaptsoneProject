In the last sprint, we made made a basic layout for the website, with a login screen.  We also have an idea on what exactly 
it is that we want in the database but we have not yet fully implemented it.  We also connected the application to a 
PostgreSQL database.  This sprint, we need to conduct a survey to see exactly what it is that providers would like in the 
application.  After receiving the survey results, we can go about adding a project to the application and showing it to users.
